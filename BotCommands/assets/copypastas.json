    "Fresh off the boat, from reddit, kid? heh I remember when I was just like you. Braindead. Lemme give you a tip so you can make it in this cyber sanctuary: never make jokes like that. You got no reputation here, you got no name, you got jackshit here. It's survival of the fittest and you ain't gonna survive long on 4chan by saying stupid jokes that your little hugbox cuntsucking reddit friends would upboat. None of that here. You don't upboat. You don't downboat. This ain't reddit, kid. This is 4chan. We have REAL intellectual discussion, something I don't think you're all that familiar with. You don't like it, you can hit the bricks on over to imgur, you daily show watching son of a bitch. I hope you don't tho. I hope you stay here and learn our ways. Things are different here, unlike any other place that the light of internet pop culture reaches. You can be anything here. Me ? heh, I'm a judge.. this place.... this place has a lot to offer... heh you'll see, kid . . . that is if you can handle it.",

Oh well I am not one of those people I am 6'4, 245lbs and I exercise every day. I would love to see you say something like that to my mother in front of me.

    "The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.",

Come talk to me when some of your family members have gone on the Zambutu bibjano; A.K.A. the trial of life. Until you have done half the **** that they have maybe you shouldn't even talk to me like this. I know you think you're hard and **** but guess what pal, you aren't.

    "The problem is your focusing on the things in life that don't really matter. When I was a kid I had hopes and dreams. We all did. But over time, the daily grind gets in the way and you miss the things that really matter, even though they are right in front of you, staring you in the face. I think the next time you should ask yourself Am I on the right track here?. I don't mean to be rude but people like you I really pity. So maybe you could use the few brain cells you have and take advantage of the knowledge I have given you now. Good luck.",
    "It's funny how just the fact that Capitaine calls this a speedrun caused most of the hype and the annoyance...like doing this as a challenge run with your own rules would have been whatever but having something like All Bosses Crapplemage Speedruns, in the title caused all the fuss... I mean you can call anything random a speedrun at the end of the day.",
    "Don't mind if people use glitches in speed runs but in my opinion a real Speed runner should finish the game from start to finish the way the developers intended you to play the game. Glitches are unforeseen anomalies that are unintentional. I mean if you use glitches by all means go for it but if you do it makes the speed run seems less impressive since you skip most of the game.",
    "Weapon swapping does not fit into the confines of what is reasonable. That's not even a matter of an opinion. I have every reason to believe that the Black Firebomb trick on the BoC works legitimately, and that the speedrunner in the posted vid used it so. The problem is that, I don't care. As soon as I found out that he weapon swapped the entire playthrough went down the crapper.",
    "People who cheat live in a crazy world, in which they do whatever the heck they want. For all I know, or am concerned with, everything I see in this run is false. It means nothing. I don't even care if the Black Firebomb thing works as how he uses them, because he cheated to get there. I have to assume he can't beat the bosses without cheating.",
    "Haha no need to be all butt hurt now. If you dont think glitching is cheating then i guess your dumbass can go on thinking that. I cant change your mind if your that stupid. Dark Souls was easy and boring. Its so dumb some one has to get on their knees and suck some serious dick just to get a 3rd one",
    "Yes, if you want to be pedantic, it's a glitch, but I would argue that intentionally triggering a glitch is hacking a game. Game glitches are typically triggered by following a specific set of actions - those actions are manipulating the game state in order to break the normal flow. That falls under the realm of hacking because the game wasn't designed to be beaten this way.",
    "I'm not against the idea of speed-runs, I think they're a fun idea for some games. But why do people think that any exploit that gets you somewhere faster makes a speedrun legal? Oh look I finished Half Life 2 in 10 minutes I AM THE KING! ... um, no, you just used some exploit to get to the end really fast. That's not skillful.",
    "This is why I'm continually baffled by people who still obsess over speed-running Dark Souls when a speedrun of that game consists of glitch the hell out of weapons and souls and floors as much as possible. If you ask me, that's not a speed run. That's skipping the game. Speed-running should involve, y'know, playing it.",
    "This is not speed run. it's like use cheating: you cross half game over the air. this? is not honestly, I think. IMHO - this is not rightly - to go like it. It is immitating of complete of the game. It is not speed run...And the end is sux. And one of you has problem - hi is looking for the asses. For Doggy-doggy ass too. how old him? 11? 12?But it was looking perfect. Not game - speed!",
    "In case some of you don't know or haven't heard about Capitaine before, know that he and his entire stream is just a huge trolling act, he is playing a role and what you see on that stream is not his real self. Most people know this and watch him for the comedic value of the role he is playing",
    "congratulations mate. very well done. from an entertainment standpoint I'd rather watch the videos with different jumps that don't require quitting the game. like in blighttown, you could have done the triple wheel drop, but you did the quit wheel drop instead. people who don't quit the game max at like 1hr15min30sec though",
    "don't be mistaken: nobody cares about speedrunning wrs in real word.. the only purpose for these things is to be fun/entertaining to watch.. yes, i really do think, if they had to omit situations like i linked, they'd have to change their strategies, even if just a bit.. or maybe a huge bit, who knows (but i certainly won't check again, i don't like watching loading screens, i can e.g. watch my toilet flushing instead)",
    "Would love to see just one speedrun video that isn't some asshat breaking the game and skipping content never understood what makes it so popular just makes it a little boring imo part of the fun of speedrunning was cutting time off when it first got popular not skipping whole sections of gameplay :s what happened?",
    "I am so tired of seeing live streams of so-called speedrunners who have to kill Gundyr repeatedly without ever finishing a run. It is a simple 1 v 1 fight. He has a weapon, you have a weapon. It is the first main boss in the game. There is no excuse for failing to kill him 100% of the time. Why don't speedrunners just practice?",
    "Yeah. All glitches are acceptable in speed runs. Something I can never agree with. Watching a speed run, some guy uses a glitch to fall through the map and skip 80% of the game. He beats the game in 20 minutes and sets a world record for beating that game the fastest. Doesn't feel legit to me, but I'm always downvoted when I express this opinion on any xxx has set new world record in xxx with a time of 42:54, he used several glitches and exploits to get this time. Just wrong.",
    "Why do people speed run? FROM didn't put a time limit on the game, the devs obviously don't want you to speed run. I don't understand why people gimp themselves by speed running when they could just take as much time as they need to carefully progress through the game. Speed runners think they're better than the rest of us, but I just laugh at them as I clear the game at a leisurely pace. I have to say, I don't advise any of you to speed run, it's just silly.",
    "Someone told me about a great run at ESA of Bloodborne by MrTakahashi. I watched it all the way through. What a joke. I counted at least 3 examples of going out of bounds to skip difficult areas. That, to me, is cheating. If a player has to go out of bounds then I can only assume that it is because they cannot survive in bounds. Fair enough to MrTakahashi for what he achieved but I cannot say well done to a cheater.",
    "In my opinion it isnt a speed run if you use a glitch like that to skip half the game. There was a speed run of under 1h performed by a japanese player on youtube. That was skill. He used shortcuts and insanely well times strategies to get through the game. One involved jumping off the elevator in the duke's archives to skip half the level (I tried for 2h to replicate it and died every time) or jumping around the lava in demon ruins to skip killing ceaseless discharge. That was skill.",
    "You talk so much about programming, but you can't talk about hacking because you can't actually do anything. I run a hacked network of computers that I programmed to click on Google's ads in my secret website. I even write my own viruses to make people get hacked into my network. I work at home and have a bunch of screens showing me what people on my network are doing on their screens. I can even set it so that I can see the code of their computers. Can you guys do any of that? I don't think so. I bet you don't know where all the websites real hackers hang out are either? If you name them, I just might tell them that marshviperX sent you.",
    "Cry is free is one constantly used sentence to users who are complaining about something. But what most don't know, is that this sentence is actually a huge lie. As far as we know, tears consist of water and 0,9 gram salt per litre. And both of these ingredients are not free.Here I listed the price for 10 litre tears for the countries of the G8.

    "This is what's great about getting old. I'll read this, forget all of the information and go see the movie. I will enjoy it, half way through the movie I'll forget what the plot is, get confused and go to the parking lot and try to find my car by holding my keys over my head and pushing the panic button until my alarm goes off. Which will scare the shit out of me, and I will think it is a cop, because I already have one arm up. I bring the other hand up and get on the ground, hands behind my back. Then I will fall asleep. The next morning I will find my car, a mere three feet away. I get inside and discover the battery has somehow died, so I call a tow company. After an hour, for some reason, a tow truck shows up and a black man starts running toward my car. He's screaming, so I lock the windows and hide in the back seat. I never realize that I've set myself on fire from the cigarette I forgot that I'd lit twenty minutes ago. I become an hero. This thread is great. My name is George, are there rules on this internet page?",
    "Anonymous, I know who you are. You're almost invariably male, Caucasian, middle-class. Your parents were normal, vanilla folks. Maybe you had a sibling or two. You went to a public school, pulling high or middlish grades with ease and relative disinterest. You didn't really gel with most of the other kids; you found them boring, they found you weird. Your contempt for the average person grew with your age, never seizing control like in some emo dipshit, but simmering casually in the back of your head. When some asshole who could barely read got hurt, you probably laughed. When some stuck-up skank got herpes, you probably smiled. Chances are you got on well enough with your teachers; you weren't a preening asshole like many of your peers, at least showed vague interest in learning, and perhaps the teacher sensed and picked up on your general contempt for others in your classes. This trend no doubt continued into college, if you had the motivation to bother. It's a bit of an exaggeration to say you hate women: you don't, after all, enjoy the socializing game. You're probably no Don Juan, either. You long ago began to think of women as disappointingly petty, but you still hope to encounter someone interesting at some time or another. You enjoy being anonymous because it is a release from the normal world: no anonymous has an identity, no anonymous is a preening faggot. Anonymous realizes he is just a guy fucking around on the internet. Anonymous knows others of his kind enjoy this fact, too. You despise the furfag, the gaiafag, the internet tuff guy for one simple reason: he acts like the internet is the real world, a place where actions should have social consequences and where there needs to be a pecking order.

I see it pasted everywhere by low life unoriginal fucking shit cunts such as yourself. And you know what, it isn't funny. I didn't even giggle. I didn't even smile a little bit. NOT EVEN A FUCKING LITTLE BIT. You could have got a psychologist to analyse my facial expressions and body language and they'd come up with fucking nothing. I am dead inside when I read your memes, and I have to listen to Evanescence to wake me up inside again. I had absolutely no emotion at the bottom of my soul, a part from disgust. I hate this meme bullshit, more than I hate that shitty doge meme. You're probably like doge meme is so funny le wow xDDD. Fucking shitty meme copying faggot plebeian. How do you live with yourself? Being so mentally deficient that you are physically incapable of an single original thought, that you have to copy paste shitty internet memes? How sad. How pathetic. Why don't you kill yourself? If I were you, I'd honestly kill myself right now. Memes are an art. Memes take effort and artistic integrity to create, and you think you can just spam that stupid shit and pass it as a 'meme'. You don't know what MEMEING is. Every meme I've created is original, and actually funny, you don't know anything about harvesting memes. You're honestly a fucking deadset idiot, ruining the meme community for you own pathetic self indulgences. You seriously think this copypasta is funny? LOL you're a deadset fucking mentally deficient cunt.",
    "Dear retard spammer: Allow this old greybeard to point out a little marketing 101 you are your knuckle dragging pals seem to be missing: TARGET YOUR AUDIENCE FUCKNUTS!!! This a geek central dipshit. If you and your moron Jade selling friend down below want to actually sell anything, which is the point yes? Then TARGET YOUR AUDIENCE FUCKNUTS!!! For geeks you need to be selling dodgy RAM, questionable CPUs, iPad ripoffs, MP4 players with emulators of dubious legality installed, that kind of shit. Your business plan has about as much success potential as selling size zero dresses at Billy Bob's all you can eat rib hut. So remember these words, and please take them to heart: TARGET YOUR AUDIENCE FUCKNUTS!!! Thank you and have a NICE day...douchebag.",
    "When you cry and your family doesn’t hear you because they are in a different room across the house and you have a pillow over your face because you want to die because your cat died two days ago from a boat accident and your parents are getting a divorce because they have different views on politics and fight all the time, which wakes up your cat but not anymore because he’s dead because of that boat that had a dog on it and a drunk guy who was named John and went to alcohol after his wife and kids left him for your science teacher that you don’t like very much because he’s pretty salty like a french fry that was lathered in the mineral that goats climb up mountains to lick with their tongues that are slimy because saliva is wet like the tears that fall down your face because your cat and the boat and your parents and Donald Trump who probably smells a lot like ham and Funyuns because Funyuns are pretty tasty and he bathes in ham juice and funyun crumbs, which is weird because any respectable presidential candidate would know better to not bathe in ham juice and Funyuns because he has a reputation to uphold and needs to impress the ladies that are trying to get money from a successful sugar daddy because they’re desperate with the soul of envy that shines like an emerald glowing in a cave, a fairy dies of fear.",
    "Something horrible happened to me today. This girl that I liked walked up to me during lunch break, along with her friends following her. I was very nervous already -like I always am with girls- and could tell from the heat on my face I was heavily blushing, which made me even more nervous. To add to that, her friends were laughing behind her shoulders, so I smelled something fishy right away. The worst thing that has ever happened to me then occurred. Never in my life have I felt so miserable. She looked at me with a grin on her face, and told me that first off she never liked me, and was just playing with me for a laugh. Then, she added that I was ugly and that no one would ever want to be with someone like me. Behind her, her friends were laughing and capturing the whole scene with their camera phones (so yeah, it was probably planned from the start, all to have a big laugh at me) I didn't even know how to react, so many people were around and looking at me that I just felt I was going to fall unconscious. I walked out of there mechanically -I was barely able to think- as quickly as I could with tears I was hardly keeping and went to the bathroom to CRY. I hadn't cried for years and there I was, in the fucking canteen's bathroom crying. I'm a fucking loser and I hate myself SO FUCKING BAD. I hate girls and I hate humans. They rob you of every single piece of self-esteem you have for their own self-enjoyment. How the fuck am I supposed to go on with life when people are so horrible? FUCK",
    "The best (and the only tolerable) tripfriend is YOYO, the rest of you are abominations unto nature, seriously, have you ever seen a woman, does your life even have an ultimate goal, does your existence have a purpose, do your parents love you, the answer is no, you worthless, cunt-hating, cockcollecting, turdsniffing, batty crease licking sad sacks, no one likes you, you don't have any friends, that's why you're in these threads, you horrible faux-humans, you don't even deserve to be called humans, you fucking faggot-ass monsters, your kind has no future, if you were kittan, humanity would be extinct, your children will not have the Y-chromosome you bunch of pansy-ass sissies, oh that's right, you won't get any children anyway, you like little girls and argue for hours trying to justify it, fucking bunch of yellow cunt homos, I'd rather adopt an empty beer can than you at your cutest, I'd rather eat canned meatballs than your dick, you fail in life like your father fails at pooping in the toilet, your ass reeks of shit, don't you even know how to wipe it, you disgust me so, you cunt-ass nigger, if i ever meet you in real life I'll snap you in half like a chocolate-chip cookie, I've already puked on my keyboard thrice while writing this, you make middle-aged beergutted frenchmen look sexy, you disgust me, just kill yourself, you disgusting son of a thousand fathers. Sieg YOYO!",
    "Are you really telling ME to stop? What a mistake you are conspiring my man. If you really knew who I am then you would actually know how to deal with the insurmountable trip I'm taking you on, no stops until we reach avici hell, a place suited for the likes of you. Nobody, listen here my man, NOBODY, has ever had the will neither the courage to tell me to stop, but yet you, as an ignorant fool, you prefer to tell me to stop. Yes, I understand that you are a human, but you should at least have the bare minimum common sense to know that such actions can have proportional consequences. Now now, I hope you are one of those who prefer death before living, hopefully you will enjoy what is going to happen to you. That doesn't mean it will hurt less or anything like that, just to be clear on that point. I'm laughing at you right now, for you don't realize or have the tiniest idea of what's coming your way. You may not even realize, but since this precise moment, I already started moving, my man. This is not a reminder, neither a warning. This is a mistake that is going to be corrected in no time.",
    "I recently came upon 4chan when a friend recommended I visit the sites for a few laughs. I figured What the hell? I could use some laughs. I must say that when I came on I was disgusted and not amused at all. Why you ask? Because everything on this entire site is literally shit! I mean yes there is funny pictures posted every now and then. But honestly; Do any of you little shits have a life? I mean are you so immature and unintellegant that you find things like cartoon porn and random naked woman shaking their boobs funny? GROW UP! Grow up 4chan. You all seriously need a reality check, You could be doing so many things in the day, yet you all choose to sit around on your fucking fat ugly asses and post pictures and then make sarcastic or idiotic comments like tits or gtfo and o rly?. Get off you fat asses and do something better with your life. I mean all of you have no life, no social life either for that matter. The supposed girls that come on here and converse with you are just as much losers are you, they are either fatter then fatty-tan or a term you'd better understand A trap. Well I've put in my two cents, and on a last note, I will do everything in my power to expose this site to people who will reacte legally upon this disgusting filthy site. This is not the end. It's just beginning. Grow up!"
